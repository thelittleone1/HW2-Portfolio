# HW2-Portfolio
HW2 Creating a Portfolio
In this HW I created a portfolio

I have put a temp avatar as a place holder.

I have three <nav> links in the top header of the page for
   1) About Me
   2) Projects
   3) Contact Info
  
  My projects are just fillers right now but once I have some I can put accurate images and they will deply an actual application
  
  I created an <aside> to hold further information in the futre
